# CodeToGive - Team 5
## The Task:
Create an entertaining, engaging, and accessible application which generates a sensory experience for users and aids in CHAS’s mission in creating a ‘moment of joy’ for children and young people referred to CHAS.
The solution should consider its intended users and their needs. CHAS provides care for children and young people in Scotland with life-shortening conditions, with several differing medical conditions which can impact mobility and cause sensory impairments, including but not limited to, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome, Motor Neuron Disease, Brain Tumours, Genetic Muscle Disorders, Hearing and Visual Impairments as well as Global Developmental Delay and other additional support and learning needs.


##Our App: WeeWonders
Through new technologies like eye-tracking and keeping accessibility at the forefront of our decisions, we created a unique storytelling adventure based on classic Scottish children's nursery rhymes. Children can customise their character and journey through a story experience uniquely tailored to them and their needs.
